# Dynamic Car Charger

Self-made adaptive sustainable-energy charging with a [go-eCharger](https://go-e.co/produkte/go-echarger-home/).  

You need a summeriazed value of a Smart-Meter which indicates how many Watt you currently receive from or delivery to your power provider.  

The go-eCharger will be turned on and off automatically, also the Ampere is automatically adjusted.  

Note: Currently it is made for a single line connection of the go-eCharger only (no 3 phase connection). Because with that it is possible to adjust the ampere from 6 to 16. If you connect the charger with 3 phases then the minium charging power will be 3 * 6 ampere, this is to much for my PV power plant.
